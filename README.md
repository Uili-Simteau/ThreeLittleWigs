## Description
This preface is the brief description of my project, Three Little Wigs, The Web App.

My wife and I run a small side business called Three Little Wigs (TLW), which supplies wigs and hairpieces to cancer and hair-loss patients.

My wife carries out consultations with prospective wig clients. This app is going to be designed as a front end business card for the wig customer, and as a consultation, and administration tool, for us, the business client/owner.
